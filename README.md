# multiple-regression-python-project
The goal of this project was to do linear and multiple regression in Python without using any libraries - in other words, from scratch. This definitely could have been accomplished with all of two lines of code in R or using a statistics library in Python, but the point of this project was to do it by hand. It was a fun challenge for sure.
